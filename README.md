This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where components try to access state properties before the asynchronous operations that set those properties have finished.  The bug.js file shows the buggy code, and the bugSolution.js file provides the solution.  The bug occurs when attempting to use data that is being fetched asynchronously before the fetch has completed.
